Hi, I'm Ema/k3rber0s!
I study Bioinformatics at University of Copenhagen & I'm C++/python developer. 

I'm currently focusing on 
  1. simulation engine development for coarse-grained protein models /w Lucie Nova (https://physchem.cz/research/soft-matter-theory/),
  2. docking simulations on SARS-CoV-2 helicase nsp13 in all-atomic resolution /w Martin Lepsik and a team from our uni (https://bioinfo4eu.unimi.it/2022-23-meet-eu-course/).

I’m looking to collaborate on multiomics & microbiome research projects.
